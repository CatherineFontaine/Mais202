# Mais202
For this project, I first had the intention to retrained a Holistically nested edge detection model. However, I was running into difficulties 
and with the deadline approaching I decided to change my project. Therefore, I did an image classification model. I used this Kaggle dataset 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/100-bird-species. Howerver, I only used 11 species of that dataset which are Asian green bee eater, Bufflehead, 
Caspian tern, Crimson sunbird, Eastern yellow robin, Greater prairie chicken, Merlin, Milatary macaw, Ovenbird, Oyster catcher and Wood duck.
Then by following https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/classification procedure, I implemented a model that you can find under MAIS202project.py. 
The final results are 96% of validation. The folder good_birds as the images after the data augmentation. Therefore from one image, I created two mores 
images which are the orginal image flipped and brighter.
